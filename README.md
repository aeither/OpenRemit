*   **Instant Feedback:** Get immediate success or error notifications for every transaction.
*   **Smart Contact Management:** Save family members once, then simply select them from an easy dropdown when sending money.
*   **Database-Backed Storage:** All transactions are securely stored with full details including amounts, notes, and recipient information.

## Problem It Solves

For parents, managing digital moneyâ€”whether it's for allowances, gifts, or helping family membersâ€”can bring new worries and complexities:

1.  **Fear of Mistakes:** Those long, cryptic digital addresses are confusing! It's easy to worry about sending money to the wrong place. OpenRemitâ€™s AI and contact list drastically reduce this risk. You can use familiar names like "Mom" or "Alex," and our AI helps ensure it goes to the right person.
2.  **Complexity of Web3:** The world of digital currencies can seem like it's only for tech experts. OpenRemit provides an easy-to-use interface that feels as natural as sending a text message, making digital finance accessible to everyone in the family.
3.  **Time-Consuming Processes:** Traditional international remittances can be slow and costly. While OpenRemit starts with on-chain crypto, its AI-driven approach simplifies the steps involved in any digital transfer.
4.  **Teaching Financial Responsibility:** As kids grow, teaching them about digital money is important. OpenRemitâ€™s clear interface and transaction history can be a helpful tool for families navigating digital finance together.
5.  **Bridging Digital and Traditional Money:** (Looking ahead) Moving money between your bank account and digital wallet shouldnâ€™t be a chore. OpenRemit aims to make this seamless.

## Architecture

OpenRemit follows a modern full-stack TypeScript architecture:

1.  **Client (Browser - `app/` directory):**
    *   The UI is built with React, TypeScript, and Shadcn/UI components, focusing on ease of use.
    *   TanStack Router handles client-side navigation and route definitions (`app/routes/`).
    *   The `NebulaIntegration.tsx` component interfaces directly with Thirdweb's `Nebula.chat()` SDK for AI-driven transaction flows, after an initial intent parsing step.
    *   Wallet connectivity is managed by Thirdweb's React hooks.
    *   Client-side state and API calls to the tRPC backend are managed using TanStack Query and a tRPC client.
    *   Voice command processing and synthesis for hands-free operation.

2.  **API Layer (`app/trpc/` directory):**
    *   tRPC is used to create a type-safe API between the frontend and backend logic.
    *   `userRouter.ts`: Manages user creation/updates, CRUD operations for user-specific contacts (e.g., family member name-to-address mappings), transaction creation, and transaction history retrieval with real-time cache invalidation.
    *   `aiRouter.ts`: Contains procedures for advanced AI processing. For example, `parseUserIntentForNebula` takes raw user chat input or voice commands, uses an LLM (via Vercel AI SDK and Groq) to understand the intent and extract entities. If a contact name is mentioned (e.g., "send to Dad"), it calls the `userRouter` to resolve "Dad" to a blockchain address before the information is passed to the client-side Nebula AI.

3.  **Database (`app/db/` directory):**
    *   Drizzle ORM is used to define the schema (`schema.ts`) and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
    *   Key tables include:
        *   `users` (stores user addresses and IDs)
        *   `contacts` (stores user-specific name-address mappings)
        *   `transactions` (stores complete transaction history with amounts, notes, status, timestamps, and user relations)

4.  **External Services:**
    *   **Thirdweb:** Provides client IDs, wallet connection UI, and the Nebula AI service for understanding and preparing blockchain transactions from natural language.
    *   **Groq:** Serves as the LLM provider for the `aiRouter` to perform initial intent parsing and entity extraction before interacting with Nebula or other services.
    *   **Fiat Gateways:** (Future) Integration with payment processors for onramp and offramp capabilities.

**Flow Example (Sending money to a family member):**

1.  Mom wants to send some digital pocket money. She opens OpenRemit and either tells the AI assistant "Send Alex 10 MNT for his game" or uses the Send Money modal to select Alex from her contacts.
2.  **AI Route**: The app securely sends this request (and Mom's user identifier) to OpenRemit's `aiRouter`, which uses Groq to understand the intent and resolve "Alex" to his blockchain address via the `userRouter`.
3.  **Manual Route**: Mom selects Alex from an easy dropdown in the Send Money modal, enters the amount and optional note.
4.  Either way, the transaction details are prepared and Mom sees a clear confirmation showing Alex's name, amount ($10), and any note.
5.  When Mom confirms, the transaction is immediately saved to the database with all details (amount, recipient, note, timestamp, status).
6.  Mom gets an instant success notification: "Transaction recorded successfully! ðŸ’°"
7.  The transaction appears immediately in her transaction history with smart formatting ("Just now") and Alex's avatar.
8.  The transaction list auto-refreshes to show the new payment alongside previous family transactions.
